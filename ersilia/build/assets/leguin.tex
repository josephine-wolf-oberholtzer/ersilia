\textit{"Are we still in the South Reach?"}

\textit{"Reach? No. The islands --" The chief moved his slender black hand in
an arc, no more than a quarter of the compass, north to east. "The islands are
there," he said. "All the islands." Then showing all the evening sea before
them, from north through west to south, he said, "The sea."}

\textit{"What land are you from, lord?"}

\textit{"No land. We are the Children of the Open Sea."}

\textit{Arren looked at his keen face. He looked about him at the great raft
with its temple and its tall idols, each carved from a single tree, great
god-figures mixed of dolphin, fish, man, and seabird; at the people busy at
their work, weaving, carving, fishing, cooking on raised platforms, tending
babies; at the other rafts, seventy at least, scattered out over the water in a
great circle perhaps a mile across. It was a town: smoke rising in thin wisps
from distant houses, the voices of children high on the wind. It was a town,
and under its floors was the abyss.}
