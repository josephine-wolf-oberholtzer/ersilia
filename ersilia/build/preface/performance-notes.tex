\section{Performance notes}

Six players -- flute, bass clarinet, oboe, violin, viola and cello -- receive a
shaker -- caxixi, maraca or similar. Four players -- guitar, piano, percussion
and contrabass -- receive a chromatic pitch pipe -- a circular harmonic-like
instrument generally used for tuning vocal groups.

The shakers should be placed on or suspended from their respective performer's
music stands, or wherever convenient.

The pitch-pipes should be played by inhaling or exhaling -- as indicated --
through fully half of the circumference of the instrument, creating a rich
cluster.

For all winds, a +-symbol indicates slap tonguing.

For guitar, the coda symbol indicates a percussive damping of the strings.

Piano plays with pedal to their discretion throughout the first four sections
of the piece. The sound should be generally dry, although some pedal should be
used when appropriate for phrasing and blending, especially on tremolo
passages. The sustain pedal should remain fully depressed for the entirety of
section D. Inside-piano glissandi are notated proportional to the lower
interior portion of the instrument -- from the lowest string up to the first
cross-bar -- and should be played with the fingertip.

Percussion should use hard sticks on toms, woodblocks, snares and crotales, and
softer mallets on marimba, bass drum and tam-tam (when ergonomic to do so).

All mordents and trills are a major 2nd, unless otherwise specified. All
tremolos are unmeasured and should evoke an even, cloud-like texture.
