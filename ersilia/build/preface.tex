\section{}

\textit{In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's
life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or
black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship
of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that
you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are
dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.}

\textit{From a mountainside, camping with their household goods, Ersilia's
refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the
plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.}

\textit{They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings
which they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than
the other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still
farther away.}

\textit{Thus, when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the
ruins of abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the
bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate
relationships seeking a form.}

- Italo Calvino, \emph{Invisible Cities}
